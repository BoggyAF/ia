			<h1>A little something about me</h1>
			
			<p>For a long time now, I have had this affinity for the field of Informatics and everything it implies from how the applications and programs, I was so casually using, were functioning to how I could combine some of the programming fundamentals with my ideas of making our life easier. Yet, I came to the conclusion that I want to pursue a career in this field only when I got selected for an internship for a Dutch company. After spending enough time surrounded by professionals it made me realize this is the path I want to approach in my life.</p>
			
			<p>The key aspects that have helped me so far when it comes to software engineering are my critical thinking, problem solving skills and the ability to work as a team with those around me, skills self-acquired for the past three academic years in which I have studied logical thinking subjects such as Physics, Informatics and Mathematics. To this day I can recall one of the first programming related projects I ever built. It was a Physics assignment in the 9th grade and its goal was to showcase Archimedes principle in a more creative and user-friendly way so my take on it was replicating the behaviors of a submarine and a hot air balloon illustrating the principle as an interactive mobile game.</p>
			
			<p>After seeing how well the project was received, I started spending more time doing research on programming. It was then I came across an advertisement promoting a local mobile application development project organized by a Dutch firm named DMT so I decided to give it a try. After the recruiting period was over, I found myself being one of the few who got selected to be part of a team responsible for the development of a mobile application in an industrial environment. This experience opened new horizons in my field of interests for my future career, encouraging me to sign up for many other internships of this kind.</p>
			
			<p>Soon after the first edition of “Young Developers” got to an end, I was fortunate enough to be selected for the second edition, this time the whole project taking place in a Finnish firm. For the following ten months, most of my after-school time was fully devoted to this and another, more personal project of mine in collaboration with an American company focused on promoting E-sports competitions among the youngsters, me being in charge of managing a team, making the company’s visual design and organizing tournaments. This period of time helped me develop a critical, anticipatory thinking together with skills in areas such as leadership, communication and time management.</p>
			
			<p>When I think about my past experiences there is one memory that stands out the most. At the age of 17, when I took part in my second internship, I found myself surrounded by new people having a totally different approach on how things should be dealt with, this causing a series of issues. However soon did I realize it was holding us back and required an immediate fix. Even though it might have been difficult at the beginning, it made me a more laid back and versatile person ready to embrace new experiences with an open mind to new perspectives. </p>
